                <h2>Euphoria</h2>
                <p><strong>Synposis:</strong> A raw, stylized drama following Rue (Zendaya), a teenage drug addict navigating love, trauma, identity, and the chaos of high school life. It explores addiction, sexuality, mental health, and the darker sides of youth culture with unflinching honesty and striking visuals.</p>
                <p><strong>Review:</strong> Visually stunning and emotionally powerful. Zendaya delivers a career-defining performance, though the series can feel uneven and overly indulgent at times.

                <h2>Good Will Hunting</h2>
                <p><strong>Synposis:</strong> Will Hunting (Matt Damon), a janitor at MIT, is secretly a mathematical genius. After a run-in with the law, he’s forced to see a therapist (Robin Williams), who helps him confront his past, self-worth, and fear of emotional connection.</p>
                <p><strong>Review:</strong> A heartfelt, timeless story about genius, pain, and healing. The writing (by Damon and Affleck) and Williams’ compassionate performance make it unforgettable.

            <div class="movie-info">
                <h2>Beautiful Boy</h2>
                <p><strong>Synposis:</strong> Carmy (Jeremy Allen White), a world-class chef, returns home to run his late brother’s struggling Chicago sandwich shop. The show captures the intensity, dysfunction, and family-like bond of kitchen life with chaotic realism and heart.</p>
                <p><strong>Review:</strong> Brilliantly acted, fast-paced, and emotionally grounded. A love letter to passion, grief, and perfectionism under pressure.

            <div class="movie-info">
                <h2>The Bear</h2>
                <p><strong>Synposis:</strong> Based on true memoirs, it follows a father (Steve Carell) and his son (Timothée Chalamet) through the painful cycles of addiction and recovery. It’s a tender, devastating portrayal of love, relapse, and hope.</p>
                <p><strong>Review:</strong> Deeply emotional and honest. Chalamet is exceptional, and the film’s realism hits hard, though the pacing can feel repetitive—mirroring addiction itself.
